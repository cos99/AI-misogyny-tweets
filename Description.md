# Short description
   This project is for educational purpose. The main goal of the project is to determine whether a tweet is misogynistic or not. For this to be achieved, I used machine learnig 
algorithms from the sklearn library, trained my model and then checked the accuracy of my model, before testing it with the test samples.

  How did it work?
